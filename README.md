## AI Quiz Generation

This application uses Google's Gemini API to generate quiz questions automatically. To ensure this feature works properly in your deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Get a Google Gemini API Key:**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) and sign up/log in
   - Navigate to the API keys section and create a new API key
   - Copy the API key for the next step

2. **Configure Your Environment:**
   - For local development: Add the API key to your `.env` file:
     ```
     GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - For Render deployment:
     - Go to your Render dashboard â†’ Select your service
     - Navigate to "Environment" section
     - Add a new environment variable:
       - Key: `GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY`
       - Value: `your_api_key_here`
     - Click "Save Changes" and redeploy your application

3. **Troubleshooting AI Quiz Generation:**
   - If you encounter errors with AI quiz generation:
     - Check your console logs for API-related errors
     - Verify that your API key is correctly set in your environment variables
     - Make sure your server has internet access to connect to Google's API
     - If all else fails, the application will use fallback quiz questions

### API Rate Limits

Note that Google Gemini API has rate limits that may affect your ability to generate quizzes frequently. If you encounter rate limit errors, wait a few minutes before trying again.
